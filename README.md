This repository contains sample pentest reports I have authored. These reports demonstrate my ability to identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and communicate technical findings clearly to both technical and executive audiences.

Most of the reports will be samples from exams and simulated environments. They will contain redacted, or obfuscated, information.
